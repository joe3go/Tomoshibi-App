Project: Tomoshibi — Japanese Language Learning Conversation Function

Goal: Design and implement a user-friendly conversation feature that guides learners through practicing Japanese with AI tutors. The function should include tutor persona selection, conversation modes (guided scenario, free chat, continue previous), interactive conversation screens with real-time feedback, and progress tracking.

Requirements:

Landing / Start Page

Welcome message introducing Tomoshibi as a friendly Japanese learning companion.

Buttons for Login/Register, and Continue as Guest.

Tutor Persona Selection

Present two distinct tutor personas:

Aoi: Friendly, casual style

Haruki: Formal, professional style

User must pick a tutor before proceeding.

Conversation Mode Selection

Options for:

Guided Conversation (scenario-based practice)

Free Chat (open-ended conversation)

Continue Previous Conversation (only if logged in)

Scenario Selection (if Guided)

Display list of practical Japanese scenarios (e.g., Ordering Food, Asking Directions, Introducing Yourself, Shopping).

Show brief descriptions and estimated time for each.

Conversation Screen

Show conversation messages between user and AI tutor in chat style.

Provide input box with suggested replies and free typing option.

Sidebar with vocabulary list (furigana on kanji), grammar tips, and quick help buttons.

Real-time corrections and feedback on user input.

Option to toggle furigana display on/off.

Highlight kanji with hover explanations.

Conversation Summary

After each conversation or scenario ends, display:

Vocabulary practiced

Grammar points covered

Encouragement and progress summary

Options to retry, choose new scenario, switch tutor, or go to dashboard.

Dashboard (Logged-in users)

Show user’s overall progress, conversation history, vocabulary mastery, grammar points learned, and streaks/achievements.

Options to resume previous conversation or start new ones.

Important Integration Note:
Please ensure this new conversation functionality is incorporated smoothly without breaking any existing features or causing runtime errors. The current login, navigation, and core site functionality must remain stable and fully operational. Provide fallback or error handling especially around conversation data and persona selection to prevent issues like undefined property errors. Incremental development and thorough testing are encouraged to keep the site robust.

Style / Tone:
Friendly, encouraging, clear, and culturally appropriate for learners at beginner to intermediate Japanese levels.

Deliverables:

UI/UX flow outline covering all screens and transitions.

Sample conversation snippets for each mode (guided, free chat, continue).

Prompts and message examples for the two tutor personas (Aoi and Haruki) in both casual and formal tone.

Suggestions for vocabulary and grammar tip integration in chat.
