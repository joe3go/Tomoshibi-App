üî† 1. Vocabulary Tracker by JLPT Levels
What‚Äôs Good:

The schema is lean and targeted (good use of frequency and jlpt_level).

Grouping vocab per user by JLPT level + frequency makes for meaningful stats.

Modular frontend component idea (<VocabTracker />) is perfect for extensibility.

Suggestions:

Add timestamps (last_seen_at) to track recency ‚Äî this helps with spaced repetition later.

Consider a word_id FK to a separate vocab table so you can normalize and track kanji, kana, etc., per word:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE vocabulary (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    word VARCHAR(100),
    reading VARCHAR(100),
    meaning TEXT,
    jlpt_level VARCHAR(10)
);

CREATE TABLE vocab_tracker (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    word_id INTEGER REFERENCES vocabulary(id),
    frequency INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_seen_at TIMESTAMP
);
In the frontend, consider showing:

‚ÄúMost used N5 words‚Äù

‚ÄúLeast encountered N4 words‚Äù

A JLPT progress bar (e.g. ‚ÄúYou've encountered 230/800 N5 words‚Äù)

üí¨ 2. Word Definition Pop-Up via JapanDict
What‚Äôs Good:

Great use of async fetch on hover.

Smart UX choice ‚Äî don‚Äôt overwhelm users with full dictionary cards unless requested.

Using FuriganaText as the integration point keeps it clean.

Suggestions:

Debounce hover fetches so you don‚Äôt hammer the API:

ts
Copy
Edit
const debounce = (fn, delay) => {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
};
const debouncedHover = debounce(handleWordHover, 200);
Fallback if API fails (e.g., offline or limit hit):

ts
Copy
Edit
try {
  const res = await fetch(...);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error();
  const data = await res.json();
  setPopupContent(data.definition);
} catch {
  setPopupContent("Definition not found.");
}
Add option to save word to vocab tracker from the popup itself:

ts
Copy
Edit
<button onClick={() => addWordToTracker(word)}>Add to My Vocab</button>
‚ú® Bonus Ideas
Popup Enhancements:

Show kana + pitch accent if possible.

Let user ‚Äústar‚Äù a word (like Anki) for focused review.

Option to show example sentence on click.

Progress Dashboard:

A visual chart of JLPT level progression over time.

"You learned 12 new words this week!"
