1. Routing & Navigation Fixes:

Fix the login routing error: “Did you forget to add your page router?”

Ensure after login, users route smoothly to the hero landing page.

Fix logout behavior so that when users log out:

The app properly clears session data.

The UI refreshes and routes back to the home or login page immediately.

No stale data or cached user info remains visible.

Implement error boundaries or graceful fallback UI to handle missing personaId or other data issues.

2. Dark Theme UI with Japanese Palette:

Use this Japanese-inspired dark color palette app-wide, including dashboards and chat:

Role	Hex	Usage Example
Primary Background	#2e1a47	茄子紺 (Eggplant navy) main bg
Secondary Bg	#634950	藤煤竹 (Dusty violet) sections
Cards/Surfaces	#888e7e	利休鼠 (Tea ceremony gray) cards
Accent	#ffa94d	灯色 (Flame-orange) highlights
Text Primary	#eaf4fc	月白 (Moon white) main text
Text Secondary	#b69c9d	桜鼠 (Sakura gray-pink) captions

Ensure good contrast and comfortable reading in all areas.

3. Hero / Landing Page:

Replace existing visuals with a refined Japanese-style lantern visual:

Soft glow in 灯色 (#ffa94d).

Organic shapes inspired by 和紙 (washi paper) textures or 折り紙 patterns.

Background gradients blending 茄子紺 and 藤煤竹 for depth.

Include a welcoming headline and call-to-action in 月白 (#eaf4fc) with subtle 桜鼠 (#b69c9d) accent highlights.

4. Chat Interface:

Use illustrated portraits of Haruki (female) and Aoi (male) as chat icons.

Both images should share a consistent modern style with soft edges and colors from the palette.

Display their names clearly near the icons using 桜鼠 (#b69c9d).

Ensure the UI is clean and fits well within the dark theme.

5. Dashboard Enhancements:

Add dynamic visual elements such as:

Interactive graphs (line, bar, pie charts).

Progress bars and KPI indicators.

Subtle animations on data updates (smooth transitions).

Use the palette colors to style graph elements:

Background areas in 茄子紺 or 藤煤竹.

Highlight bars/lines in 灯色.

Text and labels in 月白 and 桜鼠.

Ensure charts are responsive and visually balanced on dark backgrounds.

6. Additional Technical Notes:

Ensure all routing is handled via your framework’s router properly (React Router, Next.js routing, etc.).

Clear session/local storage on logout to prevent stale data.

Use suspense or loading indicators when fetching data for smooth UX.

Implement error handling to avoid crashes from undefined data.
