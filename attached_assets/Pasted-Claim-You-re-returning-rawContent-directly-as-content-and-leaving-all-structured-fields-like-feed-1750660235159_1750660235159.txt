Claim:
You're returning rawContent directly as content, and leaving all structured fields like feedback, vocabUsed, etc., as empty.

Your current code in generateSecureAIResponse:

const rawContent = response?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content;
return {
  content: rawContent,
  feedback: undefined,
  vocabUsed: [],
  grammarUsed: [],
  suggestions: [],
};

✅ Confirmed: This is not parsed, so if the AI returns a JSON blob, the frontend receives just a string — breaking structure-dependent logic.
✅ 2. Fix: Enforce response_format: "json_object"

Claim:
OpenAI needs to be told explicitly to return JSON format.

You’re missing this in your generateSecureAIResponse:

response_format: { type: "json_object" }

✅ Confirmed: Adding this ensures GPT returns a parseable JSON object, not raw Markdown or text.
✅ 3. Fix: Proper JSON Parsing

Claim:
You need to parse the structured response, fallback safely, and log if it fails.

Suggested:

let parsedResponse;
try {
  parsedResponse = JSON.parse(rawContent);
} catch (e) {
  console.error("❌ Failed to parse AI response:", rawContent);
  throw new Error("Invalid AI response format");
}

✅ Confirmed: This is best practice. Your current code doesn’t attempt to parse anything — which breaks expectations for vocabUsed, grammarUsed, etc.
✅ 4. Fix: Prompt Builder Must Include JSON Format Instruction

Claim:
You need to explicitly instruct the model to return structured data in a specific format, e.g.:

Respond only in JSON with this structure:
{
  "response": "こんにちは！",
  "english_translation": "Hello!",
  "feedback": "Good job!",
  "vocabUsed": [123],
  "grammarUsed": [456],
  "suggestions": ["Practice て-form."]
}

✅ Confirmed: Your buildDynamicPrompt() must include this format, otherwise the AI may not follow the intended structure even if response_format: json_object is set.
✅ 5. Impact on Frontend Behavior

Claim:
Your frontend assumes a complete structure with vocabUsed, grammarUsed, feedback, etc. — but gets a flat string or malformed JSON. Hence:

    Mutation appears successful (logs show ✅)

    UI tries to access message.vocabUsed etc., but they're missing or undefined

    Message state never re-renders properly = perpetual "Thinking..." issue

✅ Confirmed: This is consistent with all symptoms you've logged, including:

    Messages logged as “✅ Added”

    Cache update occurs

    No UI rendering

✅ 6. Verification Steps Are Correct

    Log parsed response:

    console.log("🗣️ Parsed OpenAI Response:", parsedResponse);

    Confirm structure with forced English (e.g. "Hello!") to verify JSON.

    Use DevTools > Network > POST /api/chat/secure to confirm structured response.

✅ Verdict

Deepseek's advice is solid and entirely correct.

You should immediately:

    Enforce response_format: "json_object" in your OpenAI call

    Add JSON parsing logic in generateSecureAIResponse

    Update your system prompt to instruct GPT to reply in JSON

    Adjust fallback values to avoid empty arrays or undefined fields
