Design a high-quality, soft dark UI theme for the existing web app Tomoshibi, a conversational Japanese language learning platform. This is not a redesign, but a visual enhancement of the existing interface.

The goal is to move away from harsh black or plain dark gray backgrounds and instead use softer tones, twilight gradients, and subtle textures to make the app feel more welcoming, serious, and immersive—appropriate for focused study while retaining warmth and personality.

🎯 Design Intent
Maintain dark-mode benefits while introducing color depth and softness

Ensure the design feels professional, trustworthy, and distinctively Japanese-inspired

Avoid “gamer” or “cyberpunk” vibes — aim for elegance and focus

🌘 Color Palette Suggestions
Use a muted twilight or deep indigo theme with warm and calming accent tones.

Background
Primary: #181B24 (deep blue-gray)

Secondary surfaces: #1E222D, #232835

Alternates: Slight gradients from #1B1F29 to #232A38

Text
Primary: #E8E8E8 (soft off-white)

Secondary: #A5A9B2 (muted gray-blue)

Links/Highlights: #FFB86B (warm amber) or #82AAFF (calm blue)

Accents
Flame-inspired orange: #FF7733 (used sparingly for highlights, CTAs)

Sakura pinks or earthy reds for subtle Japanese touches

Optional: Midnight purple or deep teal for secondary accents

🧠 Typography
Font: Friendly and legible, e.g., Noto Sans JP, Inter, or Work Sans

Avoid stark contrast; instead, balance weight and color

Line height: 1.5–1.6 for comfort in conversation bubbles

🧩 UI Component Guidelines
Chat Interface
Use rounded message bubbles with layered shadows

Differentiated colors for user vs. AI messages:

User: #2C313E bubble with light text

AI: #262B35 or gradient background

Allow space between bubbles and a soft vertical rhythm

Navbar & Header
Slight transparency with backdrop-blur-sm

Logo and flame symbol subtly glowing or embossed

Hover effects: soft underline or glow using accent color

Hero Section
Background: Gradient (e.g., #1A1F2A → #232B36)

Typography: Large, bold but soft

CTA button in warm flame orange with hover glow

Persona avatars lightly edge-lit for glow effect

Buttons & Inputs
Primary buttons: Rounded xl, flame orange fill

Secondary: Outlined in accent tones

Input fields: Semi-transparent fill, inner shadows

Focus states: glow or soft border animation

🔐 Accessibility
Maintain WCAG AA contrast standards (or better)

Ensure keyboard focus states are clear

Add aria-labels to Japanese furigana/kanji popups

💡 Styling Inspiration
Japanese minimalism meets cozy twilight lounge

Inspired by anime interfaces (Your Name, Garden of Words) or Japanese café/bookstore interiors

Add optional animated ember/flame effect in idle background

Subtle shadows, layer depth (not flat dark UI)

⚙️ Implementation Notes
Use Tailwind CSS with custom theming (preferred)

OR define custom CSS variables (--bg, --surface, --accent) for theming flexibility

Ensure responsiveness and accessibility from the start

Must not break existing layout; this is a visual update
