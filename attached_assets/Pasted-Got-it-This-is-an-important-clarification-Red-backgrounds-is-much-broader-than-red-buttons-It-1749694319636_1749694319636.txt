Got it. This is an important clarification! "Red backgrounds" is much broader than "red buttons." It indicates a design aesthetic change for certain elements currently styled with a red background, and you want their text to be white for better readability.

Let's refine that point in the prompt to be absolutely crystal clear.

Prompt for AI Builder: Iteration 2 - Addressing Feedback & New Requirements (Revised)

Please implement the following fixes and enhancements, building upon previous instructions:

1. Account Settings / Profile Pop-up Overlap Fix:

Issue: When attempting to access "Account Settings" (or a similar link), a "Profile & Settings" pop-up currently appears on top, preventing access to "Account Settings."
Requirement: Resolve this layering issue. The "Profile & Settings" pop-up should be removed or restructured so that "Account Settings" (and any related, distinct settings panels) are directly accessible and not obscured by other pop-ups. Ensure a clear and direct path to all settings options.
2. Chat Session Ending Functionality Fix (Critical):

Issue: The "End Session" functionality for chats is currently not working consistently across the platform. Sessions remain active even after the user attempts to end them.
Requirement: Thoroughly fix the 'End Session' functionality for all chat sessions. When a user presses the 'End Session' button (e.g., in Conversation History or on the Dashboard), the session must reliably terminate and update its status to 'Completed'.
3. Text Color for Red Background Elements (Revised from "Buttons"):

Requirement: For any UI element that currently has a red background (this includes, but is not limited to, buttons, chat bubbles, and other UI components), change the text color displayed on top of that red background to white. This must be achieved without breaking or negatively impacting any existing CSS or Tailwind styles.
4. User Chat Message Display Logic & Styling Fix (Critical):

Issue: When a user sends a message in a chat:
It initially appears in the same color and on the same side of the chat interface as the AI's response.
Only after the AI's response is received does the user's message then shift to the right side of the chat and display with a red background.
Requirement: Correct this behavior to provide an instant and visually distinct user experience:
The user's message must appear instantly upon sending.
It should immediately be displayed on the right side of the chat interface.
It must immediately have a red background (or the designated background color for user messages) from the moment it appears. It should never initially display with the AI's styling or position. The text on this red background must be white for optimal visibility, as per the instruction in point 3.
