Please implement the following features and fixes to improve the user experience and functionality of the application:

1. User Profile & Settings:

Implement a 'Settings' option, accessible by tapping/clicking the user avatar located in the top-left corner of the application interface.
Within this settings panel, provide functionality for the user to upload a unique profile image. This image should replace the current user avatar across all relevant sections of the application.
2. Terminology & Avatar Consistency:

Globally update all instances and references of the term 'AI Encounters' to 'Tutor' across the entire application.
Continue Learning Cards: In the 'Continue Learning' cards, ensure that the tutor's actual avatar image is displayed. Currently, this section shows placeholder kanji text; this must be replaced with the corresponding tutor's avatar, mirroring the display behavior seen in the 'Meet Your Tutors' section.
3. Chat Session Management & Display:

Session Status Accuracy: Upon completion of a chat session, its status must accurately update to 'Completed' instead of remaining 'Active'.
Dashboard Date Display: Eliminate the 'Invalid Date' placeholder text from all session entries displayed on the Dashboard.
Conversation History 'End Session': Ensure the 'End Session' button within the 'Conversation History' effectively and correctly terminates the respective chat session.
Dashboard Quick Actions: Implement a concise 'Continue Session' or 'End Session' option directly on the Dashboard for quick access, specifically for active or resumable chat sessions.
4. Real-time Chat Experience:

Instant User Message Display: When a user sends a message in a chat session, their message must appear in the chat interface immediately, without waiting for the AI's response. Currently, both user and AI messages appear simultaneously after the AI processes its response; this must be corrected so the user's message is visible instantly.
'Start a Chat' Button State: Rectify the behavior of the 'Start a Chat' button(s) such that only the specific button that was pressed displays a 'Starting...' or similar loading state, rather than all available 'Start a Chat' buttons simultaneously.
5. Vocabulary Tracker Navigation:

Confirm and ensure that a 'Back to Dashboard' button is consistently available and clearly visible on the 'Vocabulary Tracker' page, allowing for easy navigation back to the main dashboard.
6. Chat-Specific Settings & Notifications:

Implement a dedicated 'Chat Settings' section (please specify the access point, e.g., accessible from within an active chat session or the main settings panel).
Within these 'Chat Settings', provide controls for:
Sound Notifications: A toggle switch to enable/disable sound notifications for incoming chat messages.
Desktop/Browser Notifications: A toggle switch to enable/disable desktop or browser-level notifications for new chat messages.
7. Main Application Settings Enhancements:

Augment the existing 'Main Dashboard Settings' with the following functionalities:
Change Password: Provide a secure interface for users to change their account password.
Update Display Name: Allow users to update their public display name within the application.
Send Feedback: Integrate a 'Send Feedback' option. This should facilitate sending user feedback directly via email to feedback@tomoshibiapp.com. (Please clarify if this should open the user's default email client with the address pre-filled, or if it should be an in-app form that dispatches the email.)
