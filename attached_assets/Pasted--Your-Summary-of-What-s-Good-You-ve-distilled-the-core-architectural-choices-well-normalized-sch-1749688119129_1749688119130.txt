✅ Your Summary of What’s Good:
You’ve distilled the core architectural choices well — normalized schema, modular frontend, JLPT grouping, and smart UX like pop-ups.

Highlighting the last_seen_at + progress bars is crucial — that bridges passive exposure and active recall. ✅

You've preserved the focus on clean frontend architecture with FuriganaText and VocabTracker.

🧠 What You Did Really Well:
You repackaged the technical suggestions in a way that shows you understand the "why" behind them (e.g., data normalization for kanji/kana/meaning, debounce for performance).

The callout on visual motivation like “You've encountered 230/800 N5 words” is huge — users love quantifiable growth.

Including the fallback and failure handling in your hover-fetch logic shows production-readiness thinking.

💡 Advanced Suggestions (Optional Polish)
Since you’re at a solid architectural point, here are a few “next-level” touches if you want to go even further:

🔁 1. Spaced Repetition Tiering
Rather than relying only on last_seen_at, you could eventually include a memory_strength or next_review_at, forming the basis for spaced SRS:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE vocab_tracker ADD COLUMN memory_strength INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE vocab_tracker ADD COLUMN next_review_at TIMESTAMP;
This lets you build light Anki-style review down the line — without full deck complexity.

📊 2. Progress Dashboard (Frontend Sketch)
Consider this minimal dashboard structure:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<Card>
  <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">JLPT Progress</h2>
  <ProgressBar label="N5" value={230} max={800} />
  <ProgressBar label="N4" value={92} max={650} />
</Card>
Each ProgressBar could link to filtered vocab lists — letting users jump in and review.

💬 3. Popup UX Enhancements
Add a tiny delay before the pop-up closes on mouseleave (200–300ms) so it's not jittery.

Let users click on the pop-up to “lock” it open — great for studying multi-word definitions.

🧩 4. Frontend VocabTracker Component Breakdown
You can structure the VocabTracker like this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<VocabTracker>
  <JLPTLevelSection level="N5" words={wordsN5} />
  <JLPTLevelSection level="N4" words={wordsN4} />
</VocabTracker>
Each JLPTLevelSection can display:

Top 5 words by frequency

A link to “see all”

Option to “reset frequency” or “mark as mastered”

🎯 Final Thoughts
You’ve got a production-grade plan already, and your revisions show clarity and confidence. If you’re building this solo or in a small team, you’ve struck the right balance between functionality and future growth.

Let me know what you'd like help with next:

A full VocabTracker React component?

SRS scheduling algorithm?

Tailwind UI layout for pop-ups?

Mockup dashboard design?

You're definitely building something people will want to use. Keep going — it’s strong.
