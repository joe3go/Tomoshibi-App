Objective:
Design a modern, high-converting hero section for Tomoshibi, a Japanese language learning platform focused on JLPT N5 conversational practice. The page should combine minimalist aesthetics with persuasive UX, leveraging dark mode for sophistication and readability.

1. Core Design Requirements
Color Palette:

Primary BG: Charcoal (#1E1E1E) with a subtle radial gradient (darker edges → slightly lighter center).

Accent Colors: Amber-to-gold gradient (CTA), soft white/light gray text.

Optional: Very faint texture (e.g., barely visible Japanese wave pattern) for depth.

Typography:

Headline: Bold, modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter or Poppins) in white (#FFFFFF).

Subheadline: Light gray (#E0E0E0), thinner weight.

Body/Features: Medium gray (#A0A0A0) for secondary text.

2. Hero Section Content
Headline:
"Speak Japanese Confidently – AI-Powered JLPT N5 Conversation Practice"
(Clear value prop + JLPT level emphasis.)

Subheadline:
"Practice real-life Japanese with AI tutors. Get instant feedback, track progress, and build confidence for the JLPT N5 exam."
(Benefits-driven, concise.)

Visual Hero Element:

Option 1: A 3D-style Japanese lantern (brand motif) with a soft glow, floating slightly above the CTA.

Option 2: Minimalist illustration of a person chatting with an AI bot, with Japanese text bubbles.

CTA Button:

Label: "Start Learning Free" (stronger incentive than "Sign Up").

Style: Amber-to-gold gradient, rounded corners, subtle shadow.

Hover Effect: Gentle pulse animation + shadow expansion.

3. Feature Highlights (3-Column Section Below Hero)
Personalized AI Tutors	JLPT N5 Scenarios	Real-Time Feedback
"Practice with AI tailored to your level."	"Everyday dialogues & exam prep."	"Instant corrections & progress tracking."
Icons: Minimal line icons (e.g., chatbot, scroll/script, progress chart).

Hover Effect: Slight scale-up + soft glow.

4. Motion & Micro-Interactions
Hero Text: Fade-in with slight upward drift on page load.

Lantern/Illustration: Gentle floating or flickering animation.

CTA Button: Smooth gradient shift + shadow expansion on hover.

5. Responsive & Accessibility
Mobile Adaptations:

Stack feature columns vertically.

Reduce hero text size (headline: 2rem, subheadline: 1.1rem).

CTA button min tap target: 48x48px.

Contrast Ratio: Ensure text meets WCAG AA standards (≥ 4.5:1).

6. Mood & Brand Alignment
Key Adjectives: Modern, warm, guiding (like a "light" in learning).

Avoid: Clutter, overbearing textures, or slow animations.

Why This Works
Stronger Conversion Focus:

CTA ("Start Learning Free") lowers barrier vs. "Sign Up."

Benefit-driven subheadline addresses user pain points.

Visual Storytelling:

Lantern/illustration reinforces brand name ("Tomoshibi" = light).

Gradient and glow effects imply warmth and guidance.

Performance-Optimized:

Subtle animations enhance engagement without slowing load times.

Dark mode reduces eye strain for prolonged study sessions.

Next Steps:

Provide brand assets (logo, exact colors) for final polish.

Specify if you prefer illustrations vs. 3D renders for the hero graphic.

Would you like any additional refinements (e.g., adding a testimonial snippet or trust badges)?
